## Goal

The goal of this project is to create a system capable of meeting the needs of small businesses that needs to manage your costumers and its interations, promote campaigns and provide reports of all  sorts.

The system must be healthy, scalable and will be developed to be prepared to grow up in modules and enhancements cycles.

## Tools

To achieve that goal, the set of technologies will be employed:

### Client-side
- jQuery (<http://www.jquery.com>)
- Underscore (<http://underscorejs.org/>)
- Backbone (<http://backbonejs.org/>)
- RequireJS (<http://requirejs.org/>)
- Twitter Bootstrap (<http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/>)

### Server-side
- PHP Laravel4 Framework (<http://four.laravel.com/>)
- MySQL

## Architecture 

Development will be split in two parts, Server and Client. The server will be a RESTful, serving only JSON data accordingly to HTTP request it receives. The client will be responsible of all User Interface and Interation.

The modeling has to be decided first, and this is the next step the project.
